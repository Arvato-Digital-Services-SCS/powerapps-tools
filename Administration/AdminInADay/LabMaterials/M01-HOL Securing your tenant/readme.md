# M01-HOL Security your tenant

In this hands-on lab, you will be an environment administrator for Fabrikam helping to adopt the Power Platform. You have been assigned responsibility for ensuring that Fabrikam’s employees are able to build Power Apps applications and flows using Power Automate to help them be productive. At the same time, you are expected to ensure that Fabrikam’s data and security policies are followed.
Some of Fabrikam’s employees have already started experimenting with the Power Platform so your first task is to get an understanding of what is already in use.
Next, you will be taking steps to put some baseline security policies in place to implement Fabrikam’s data and security policies.
